# This file is provided with RetroBat
# It can be used to automatically generate specific input mappings in TeknoParrot for Arcade games
# Each container must be named exactly the same as the .xml Game Profile file and put in lowercase(without the extension)
#
# The elements listed are the <InputMapping> values for each game in Teknoparrot
# The key represents the InputMapping value in TeknoParrot XML
# The value represents the Button on the gamepad
#
# List of possible values:
# r3, l3, select, start, righttrigger, lefttrigger, rightshoulder, leftshoulder, south, east, west, north, up, down, left, right, leftstickleft, leftstickright, leftstickup, leftstickdown, rightstickleft, rightstickright, rightstickup, rightstickdown
#
# For lightguns, usually they have 3 buttons recognized as mousebuttons, to declare mouse buttons, you need to use the button hereunder as key and the InputMapping as value
# Look at the example for hotd4
# List of possible values: 
# mouseleft, mousemiddle, mouseright, button4, button5
#
# Other lightgun buttons are usually identified as keyboard buttons, in that case use:
# kb_x where x equals to a keyboard key
# kb_dy where y equals to a keyboard number key
